This gives a continous look, as each pixel blends smoothly next to one another. Next, the Oxford Slope Topography map is a choropleth map that is vector based as it uses non-continous visuals to show parcel by parcel differences in mean slope. This is a result of the first map using a DEM and the second using a zonal statistics combination of a parcel layer and the appended mean slope differences layer resulting in a completely opposite data model. By using the zonal statistics tool, a calculation of a single mean slope value from the underlying slope raster for each parcel polygon was made, which was then averaged across the entire terrain in each specific parcel. </mark>"
